# **App Name**: MedScribe AI

## Core Features:

- Note Transcription: Transcribe audio or text-based doctor's notes into a clear, readable format, removing acronyms and jargon using an AI model.
- Code Mapping: Based on the transcribed notes, identify medical conditions and map them to relevant insurance billing codes, making it easier to find and fix missed billing opportunities; the system employs an AI tool to assess which mentions are more likely to be relevant.
- Severity Assessment: Assign a severity level (low, medium, high) to each identified condition based on the information extracted from the transcribed notes; the AI model cross-references medical databases and uses its reasoning ability as a tool to identify likely severity levels based on provided information.
- Review Interface: Provide a clean and intuitive user interface for reviewing and editing transcribed notes, mapped codes, and severity levels.

- Accent color: A soft green (#90EE90) for positive confirmations and highlights. Green offers a sense of health and reassurance.
- Clear and readable sans-serif fonts for optimal readability in medical texts.
- Use minimalist icons to represent medical terms and functions, ensuring clarity and avoiding clutter.
- A structured layout with clear sections for notes, codes, and severity levels, using whitespace effectively to prevent overwhelming the user.
